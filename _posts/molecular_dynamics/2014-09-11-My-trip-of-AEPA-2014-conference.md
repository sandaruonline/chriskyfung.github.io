At the beginning of September, I participated in a conference in Kaohsiung, which is a city located in the south part of Taiwan. The conference was called the 12th Asia-Pacific Conference on Engineering Plasticity and Its Applications (AEPA 2014). The picture below is the cover of the proceeding, which printed with a beautiful sunset taken at the harbor next to the campus of National Sun Yat-Sen University. The sea view was really beautiful. Here is a photo that I took at the shore. The city was quite good except the weather was too hot every day. There were yummy seafood and fruits, such as pineapple and watermelon.
