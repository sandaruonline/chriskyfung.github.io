Recently, I noticed that the Quest "Challenge: GCP Architecture" was no longer found from the Qwiklabs Catalog. In addition, its badge, the lovely bear, disappeared from the profile. This made me felt upset.

## Where does the bear badge go?

In a nullshell, the quest (ID: 47) **Challenge: GCP Architecture** has been renamed to [Cloud Architecture - Design, Implement, and Manage](https://google.qwiklabs.com/quests/124). The URL also changed `/quests/124`. Therefore, it seems to be off-shelf. Indeed, All the labs in the quest remains unchanged. You record is still there but it is replaced with the new quest title and the new badge.
