### Useful commands

#### Show running processes in Linux

- `top`
- `ps -A`

For more infomation, please find from:

#### Get root permission for GUI file manager

- `sudo nautilus`

#### Find previous commands

- `history`
  Display a list of previous commands
- `!`_`n`_
   where _**n**_ is the index of a command displayed by history, e.g. `!4`
- `Ctrl+R` Find the historical commands
   Suggest a previous command that starts with the chars as you type

#### Execute a shell script

In Ubuntu, a shell script is a .sh file that contains a series of commands in a Unix shell, similar to a batch (.bat) file in Windows. In a .sh file, it is often typed with `#! /bin/bash` in the first line to indicate that is a [bash script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)). For example,

```bash
#! /bin/bash

echo "System"
uname -o
echo "Memory Usage"
free -m
echo "Local Library Path"
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Save as `test.sh`, and then need the file executable, by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x test.sh
```

`chmod` is a command to change file permission, `+x` is the argument to set execute permission to the file.

After that, you can `./` in front of the filename to execute the shell file in the terminal, i.e.

```bash
./test.sh
```
